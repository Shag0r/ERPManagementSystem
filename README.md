My Erp Management System Software 


### **Storyline of How the Organization Will Run**

This system will streamline the operations of a restaurant, from order placement to payment, inventory management, and reporting. The organization will operate seamlessly with various roles, including customers, staff (cashiers, cooks), and management teams handling different tasks in a synchronized manner. Here’s how the organization will run step-by-step:

---

### **1. Customer Experience**

**Order Placement**:

* **Dine-in**: Customers enter the restaurant, are seated at a table, and a waiter or the customer themselves place an order through a POS system (front-end app). Each table has a unique ID, which helps in tracking the order in the system.
* **Takeaway**: Customers can walk in and order directly, specifying that they will take the food away. Alternatively, customers can place orders via phone or online (if available) for pickup.
* **Delivery**: The customer places an order online or through the restaurant’s app, specifying their delivery address. The backend system tracks whether the order will be delivered by an in-house rider or a third-party service.

**Customization**:

* Customers can customize their orders, such as adding extra cheese, choosing the doneness of a burger, or requesting specific sauces. These modifications are tracked in the order system.

**Order Summary**:

* Once the customer has placed the order, the system calculates the total cost, including any applicable taxes, service charges, or discounts (if a promo is applied).

---

### **2. Kitchen Operations**

Once the order is placed, the system triggers various actions:

**Order Reception**:

* Orders are categorized by their type (burger, side, drink) and sent to different kitchen stations (Grill, Fry, Drinks).
* The kitchen system prints a kitchen ticket, showing the details of the order, such as the items, any customizations (e.g., “no onions”, “well-done”), and fire times (how quickly the food should be prepared).
* The kitchen staff reviews the ticket, prepares the food, and updates the order status accordingly.

**Order Status Flow**:

1. **New**: When the order is first placed.
2. **In-Kitchen**: The order is sent to the kitchen stations.
3. **Ready**: The kitchen staff notifies that the food is ready for service or pickup.
4. **Served/Picked-up**: The customer receives the order.
5. **Closed**: Once the order is completed and any payment is finalized, it is marked as closed.

---

### **3. Inventory Management**

**Ingredient Deduction**:

* When a menu item is ordered, the system automatically calculates the ingredient usage (e.g., how many buns, patties, cheese slices) based on the recipes for each item.
* The inventory system tracks the consumption and reduces the available stock accordingly. This happens in real-time as orders are placed and items are sold.

**Stock Restocking**:

* Inventory levels are regularly monitored, and if stock falls below a certain threshold, the system notifies the management that it's time to reorder ingredients.
* The purchasing system tracks supplier orders and goods receipts to ensure the restaurant maintains optimal stock levels.

**Waste and Spoilage**:

* Any waste or spoiled ingredients (e.g., expired products) are logged into the system, so they don’t get deducted from the inventory automatically.
* Management can review reports of waste to help reduce future losses.

---

### **4. Payments and Cash Reconciliation**

**Payment Methods**:

* Customers can pay using cash, card, or mobile wallets. For dine-in, payments can be processed directly at the table (if the system allows).
* When a customer is ready to pay, the order’s total is displayed on the POS system, which includes any applicable taxes and discounts.

**Split Payments & Tips**:

* For split payments, customers can divide the total between multiple payment methods. For example, they may pay half in cash and the other half via mobile wallet.
* Tips can also be added at the point of payment, and the system keeps track of which staff (cashier) processed the transaction.

**Cash Reconciliation**:

* At the end of each shift, cashiers perform a cash drawer reconciliation to match the amount of cash received against the sales report.
* The system provides a reconciliation report, detailing the total sales, tips collected, and the actual amount in the cash drawer.

---

### **5. Reporting & Analytics**

**Daily Sales Reports**:

* At the end of the day, management can generate a **Sales Report** showing total revenue, number of orders, top-selling items, and discounts applied.
* The **Z-Report** can be generated, summarizing the day's sales and providing key performance metrics.

**Inventory Reports**:

* Daily or weekly inventory reports are available, showing stock levels, purchases, wastage, and remaining stock.
* **Stock on Hand** reports help management plan for restocking items to avoid running out of stock.

**Staff Performance**:

* **Staff Performance Reports** track which cashier processed the most sales, who received the highest tips, and which staff worked the longest hours.
* These reports can be used to determine payroll, bonuses, and identify areas for improvement.

**COGS & Wastage**:

* The system tracks **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** by calculating the cost of ingredients used in each order.
* Reports on wastage show how much inventory has been wasted or spoiled, helping management adjust inventory practices.

---

### **6. Staff Operations**

**Clock-In/Clock-Out**:

* Staff members (cashiers, cooks) clock in and out of their shifts via the system. The system records the time worked and tracks hours for payroll purposes.

**Role Management**:

* Staff roles are managed based on permissions. For example:

  * **Cashiers** can manage orders and payments.
  * **Cooks** can view orders from the kitchen and mark items as ready.
  * **Managers** can generate reports, perform inventory management, and handle staff shifts.

**Shift Management**:

* The system tracks which staff worked during which shifts, allowing managers to evaluate performance and distribute tips accordingly.
* It also helps with staff scheduling to ensure adequate coverage during peak hours.

---

### **7. Customer Loyalty & CRM**

**Customer Profiles**:

* Basic **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** is used to store customer details, such as order history, preferences (e.g., allergies or preferred toppings), and loyalty points.
* For regular customers, loyalty points can be accrued based on the amount spent. These points can be redeemed for discounts or free items.

**Loyalty & Promotions**:

* The system can manage **coupons** and promotions (e.g., "20% off for your next meal") that can be applied during checkout.
* Special discounts can be offered for loyal customers or during certain times (e.g., Happy Hour).

---

### **8. Supplier & Procurement**

**Purchase Orders**:

* When inventory is low, the system automatically generates **purchase orders** to suppliers, specifying which ingredients need to be restocked.
* Once the goods are received, they are logged into the system to update stock levels and ensure accuracy.

**Supplier Management**:

* Suppliers’ contact details, price changes, and delivery history are tracked within the system.
* Any changes in pricing or supplier relationships are logged to ensure the restaurant is paying the best possible price for ingredients.

---

### **9. Optional Future Modules**

**Tax Calculation**:

* Tax rules will be implemented to automatically calculate applicable taxes based on the menu item or order type (e.g., dine-in vs. takeaway).
* Tax reports are generated to comply with Bangladesh's tax laws.

**Allergens & Nutritional Information**:

* The system can track allergens in the ingredients and ensure that customers are informed when ordering.
* Nutritional information can also be included on the menu for health-conscious customers.

**Combo Meals & Upsells**:

* Combo deals (e.g., burger + fries + drink) can be easily added, with special pricing for combos. The system can automatically suggest upsells, such as a drink with a meal, to increase average order value.

**Multi-Branch Expansion**:

* The system is designed to scale to multiple branches. Each branch will have its own set of orders, inventory, and staff management, but the central system can track overall performance and inventory across all branches.

### **Conclusion**

This system will enable smooth and efficient operations in the restaurant. It covers everything from customer orders to kitchen management, inventory tracking, payments, reporting, and staff management. The integration of these components ensures that the restaurant can run efficiently, reduce waste, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain profitability. Over time, optional modules such as promotions, customer loyalty, and multi-branch management can be added to further improve operations.
